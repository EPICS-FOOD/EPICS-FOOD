#### <ins>Getting Started</ins>
  This bot has been created using [<ins>Selenium</ins>](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/), please reference this documentation when working in this package! This page already contains an explination of how to get started with selenium on your own system, and there are many guides online.
  
##### Step 1
   Download Google Chrome to your system, and or update your current chrome version.
   Once this is done, figure out what version of Google Chrome you are running, top right, settings, help, 'about'
   Here is an example of how this should look:

   Notice that the current updated version in this image may be different than the one you are using now, no worries about this.
   
   

##### Step 2
   Download the correct webdriver for your system [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), current options MacOS, Linux, Windows

##### Step 3
   Git clone this repo, this step requires you to make sure Git is set up on your computer or that you know how to handle git. I followed this guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), I decided to download Git Bash, and set up a P.A.T. (personal access token). For long term usage, it would be wise to look into the git manager.
   
   After that, it should be as easy as "git clone https://github.com/EPICS-FOOD/EPICS-FOOD.git" in your git bash or however else you manage your local repos.
